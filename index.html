        Explore a dream world as Little Nemo, armed with toys, candy, and stuffed animals in this colorful platforming metroidvania adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland</i> takes the retro NES-era <em>platformer</em> gameplay of Capcom and Nintendo favorites, and brings
        it to a <em>vast, non-linear world</em> that has been lovingly <em>hand-animated</em> frame-by-frame which you’ll <em>explore</em> as you
        <em>collect</em> new ability-granting toys and PJs. Encounter a colorful cast of characters and discover enchanting lands inspired by Winsor McCay’s
        <i>Little Nemo</i> comics seen through the nostalgic lens of an ‘80s/’90s kid.
