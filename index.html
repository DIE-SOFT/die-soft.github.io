        <i>Little Nemo and the Guardians of Slumberland</i> takes the retro NES-era <em>platformer</em> gameplay of Capcom and Nintendo favorites and brings it to a
        <em>vast, non-linear</em> world that has been lovingly <em>hand-animated</em> frame-by-frame. You’ll <em>explore</em> as you <em>collect</em> new
        ability-granting toys and PJs, discover enchanting lands inspired by Winsor McCay’s Little Nemo comics, and encounter a colorful cast of characters —
        all through the nostalgic lens of an ‘80s/’90s kid.
