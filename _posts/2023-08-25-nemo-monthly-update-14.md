# Monthly Update 14 üåû



August is nearly over as we reach the final Friday of the month, and although that means we‚Äôre heading towards the end of summer üòî at least we get to dive into another monthly update. Before I jump into it, I just want to shout out the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/9NymgSJAVp); come give us a visit there if you haven‚Äôt already joined. It‚Äôs always nice to touch base with y‚Äôall more directly! üòä



## Unity Version Update

This month I upgraded the *Little Nemo* project from Unity 2020.3 (LTS) to 2022.3 (LTS). Wow! üéâ ‚Ä¶ what does that mean? Well here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of how Unity‚Äôs annual release cycle works:

Each year Unity releases two ‚Äútech streams‚Äù (20XX.1 and 20XX.2) which introduce new features and often break backwards compatibility while overall improving things and adding new features. New versions of their packages (non-essential features you can opt into) often will require a certain version of Unity meaning you sometimes need to upgrade Unity to upgrade your packages.

Then a third release (which usually happens in the first half of the next year) rolls up all the changes into a ‚Äúlong term support‚Äù (LTS) version. This is what you want to target as the version you‚Äôll be using when you release your game because it is considered stable (they‚Äôve been working out the bugs for the last few versions and won‚Äôt make any significant changes) but will continue to get bug fixes back-ported to it as needed.

I was previously on the LTS version from 2020, which I had originally anticipated releasing with. However, as we‚Äôve pushed back from the original release target of this year, it makes sense to get more up-to-date. If your version gets too out of date, even if you don‚Äôt need any new features, it can potentially pose a problem for getting your build published.

But the exciting thing about this LTS version, which came out fairly recently, is that it allows us to upgrade to the 1.0 release of Unity‚Äôs Entities package. This means I can move away from the preview (not suggested for production) version I have been using. There are lots of improvements to this package, which will come in very handy once I get to the optimization phase of development and I need to get every bit of performance possible for the Nintendo Switch.

I could really go into all the details about why I am using and enjoy using Unity‚Äôs DOTS systems (Data Oriented Tech Stack), but I will leave that for anyone to come ask me about in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9NymgSJAVp) (we have a #game-dev channel for anyone interested in these sorts of things).



## Content Updates

This month a lot of what I worked on was finishing up things I showed off in the last two updates which were in early states, so I‚Äôll mostly show those off, but I‚Äôve also been working on a portion of the game I am not going to be spoiling at all before release, so I specifically **won‚Äôt** be sharing any of that content with you.

We‚Äôve also got some amazing tracks in the work from Peter Berkman, but they‚Äôre not quite ready to share yet. Once those get more finalized I‚Äôll make sure to get some videos up on YouTube so you can hear a bit of them because they‚Äôre pretty amazing. üéµ



## Spoilers Abound ‚ùóüôà‚ùó



While showing off the background art for the Palace dream domain, it wasn‚Äôt quite ready, so I thought I‚Äôd show how it‚Äôs looking with the more finalized assets in the background.

I also got some more tilesets completed, so here‚Äôs a look at what the pass-thru, dangle, and alternate collision tiles look like, as well as some cleanup and polish for the main collision tiles (the red carpet is a bit nicer now and there are better wooden details within large solid tile areas).

## Dynamic Fluids  üí®üåä

Two months ago I shared the beginnings of my systems for handling fluid displacement for making some sprites reactive to player movement due to wind or moving through a liquid. I actually ran into a bit of a technical roadblock for a bit (ultimately I wasn‚Äôt able to use ShaderGraph for what I wanted and I had to write my shader manually) so I only just got back to it this month, but it‚Äôs all wrapped up now and I wanted to show off some of the ways this is used for fun effects.

This is the gunk in the Mushroom Marsh which really forced my hand on finally developing this system. I knew it just wouldn‚Äôt work without some kind of fluid-like reaction to the player entering and moving through it. As with the Entities stuff I talked about above, there are some really interesting technical details for how this is implemented, so feel free to ask for more info about it! Also shout-out to [aarthificial's wind solution](https://github.com/aarthificial/pixelgraphics/tree/master) which I looked to for inspiration.

And here is a use case we already had: dynamic foliage. It‚Äôs nice to have this stuff react to the player and other motion because it just makes the simple act of moving through the world a tiny bit more interactive and fun. All these little details add up, so I did want to eventually get this back in here (I had an earlier system, but it wasn‚Äôt quite right and worked only for foliage).

And finally, this is just a fun visual effect for a specific area of the game I won‚Äôt talk about. It's just a bit of interactive flavor that isn‚Äôt very critical, but will hopefully make the entire area it appears in come together that much better.

## A Quick Update on the Early Builds üíæ

For the Sleepwalkers reading who have access to the builds, I thought I‚Äôd give a quick update in case you‚Äôre wondering if there will be a new build anytime soon. Right now I‚Äôm trying to focus on getting a bunch of the environmental art done for all of the dream domains (there are nine total, the first three are done, I‚Äôm roughly halfway through the last three, and then I am going to do the middle three). Because I‚Äôm primarily focused on getting these art assets done, I haven‚Äôt been focusing on much ‚Äúlevel design‚Äù, so there isn‚Äôt much more to allow access to in the early build. Once I have more of the environments ready I will probably take more time to focus on filling out the world a bit more and allowing access (essentially open up some of those gates that are barring progress). I will let you all know once we get there.



## Until next month! üëã

That‚Äôs it for this month‚Äôs update. As always, thank you so much for reading and following along with the development. Comments and feedback mean a lot to me, so please share your thoughts below or in the [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/9NymgSJAVp). I‚Äôll see you Sleepyheads in another month‚Äôs time, until then!
